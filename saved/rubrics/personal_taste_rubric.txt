### Core Interests 

Core interests:

Applied AI and developer tooling – designing and shipping practical AI‑driven products; keen on the “future of programming,” especially ways LLMs can automate or augment software development workflows. You prototype with TypeScript, Next.js, Vitest, Drizzle ORM, and maintain SpecCraft (BDD‑style test logger).

Startup execution and strategy – building companies from zero to one, obsessing over product‑market fit, rapid iteration, and business model design.

Technical writing and communication – producing crisp, explanatory content about complex systems; using writing as a thinking tool.

Science‑fiction and big‑picture foresight – reading speculative fiction to explore societal and technological trajectories, then mapping those insights back to real‑world product ideas.

Deliberate thinking frameworks – favoring reflective questioning, mental models, and structured reasoning to pressure‑test assumptions and guide decisions.

Continuous learning – voracious reading across AI research, software engineering practices, and adjacent sciences to stay ahead of the curve.
