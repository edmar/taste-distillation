        "title": "AI reports in 2025 Say we are Underestimating Its Impact",
        "reasoning": "The title \"AI reports in 2025 Say we are Underestimating Its Impact\" suggests a forward-looking analysis of AI's societal or economic influence, possibly synthesizing expert opinions or new data. This aligns with the reader's core interests in technology, AI, and big-picture foresight. However, the title is somewhat generic and does not indicate actionable advice, frameworks, or personal experience. It seems more like a news analysis or trend prediction rather than a deep, practical, or contrarian exploration. Unless the article connects macro trends to personal action or startup strategy, it may not fully satisfy the reader's preference for practical takeaways or reflective frameworks. Still, the topic is relevant and could be of moderate interest.",

        "reasoning": "The title \"Test && Commit || Revert with AI - by Scott Werner\" strongly aligns with the reader's core interests in applied AI, developer tooling, and practical frameworks for software development. The reference to \"Test && Commit || Revert\" suggests a focus on a specific, actionable workflow or methodology for coding, which is likely to be practical and potentially list-based or structured—both favored content patterns. The addition of \"with AI\" indicates an exploration of how AI can augment or automate this process, directly connecting to the reader's fascination with the \"future of programming\" and LLM-driven developer workflows. The author, Scott Werner, is also associated with high-fit articles. Overall, this article promises actionable insights at the intersection of AI and software engineering, making it highly likely to be marked as a favorite.",

        "reasoning": "The title \"Wasting Inferences With Aider - by Scott Werner\" suggests a discussion about inefficiencies or pitfalls when using a tool called Aider, likely in the context of AI or LLM-powered workflows (since \"inferences\" is a term commonly used in AI\/ML). This aligns with the reader's core interests in applied AI, developer tooling, and practical product design. The title hints at a reflective or analytical approach—possibly identifying mistakes or lessons learned, which matches the preference for meta-reflection and actionable insights. If the article discusses how to avoid wasted compute or improve workflow efficiency with Aider, it would offer practical takeaways and possibly frameworks for better usage, which is highly favored. The specificity and technical focus make it a strong fit.",

        "reasoning": "This title directly references LLM-powered programming, which is a core interest—specifically, the application of AI to augment software development workflows. The metaphor of \"Mech Suit\" versus \"Artificial Human\" suggests a conceptual, possibly contrarian framing: rather than replacing humans, LLMs act as powerful augmentations. This aligns with the reader's preference for analytical, reflective, and meta-level content that explores how technology changes the way we work. The title promises a big-picture, possibly philosophical take, likely with practical implications for how developers should think about and use LLMs. This fits the taste rubric's emphasis on frameworks, actionable insights, and connecting macro trends to personal action.",

      "instructions": "Predict whether an article will be marked as favorite based on its title with detailed reasoning.\n\nUse the following taste rubric as guidance:\nTASTE RUBRIC:\n\n---\n\n### Core Interests \n\nCore interests:\n\nApplied AI and developer tooling – designing and shipping practical AI‑driven products; keen on the “future of programming,” especially ways LLMs can automate or augment software development workflows. You prototype with TypeScript, Next.js, Vitest, Drizzle ORM, and maintain SpecCraft (BDD‑style test logger).\n\nStartup execution and strategy – building companies from zero to one, obsessing over product‑market fit, rapid iteration, and business model design.\n\nTechnical writing and communication – producing crisp, explanatory content about complex systems; using writing as a thinking tool.\n\nScience‑fiction and big‑picture foresight – reading speculative fiction to explore societal and technological trajectories, then mapping those insights back to real‑world product ideas.\n\nDeliberate thinking frameworks – favoring reflective questioning, mental models, and structured reasoning to pressure‑test assumptions and guide decisions.\n\nContinuous learning – voracious reading across AI research, software engineering practices, and adjacent sciences to stay ahead of the curve.\n\n\n### 1.
