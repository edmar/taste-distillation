It promises practical, actionable content (reverse engineering APIs), which is directly relevant to applied technology, developer tooling, and continuous learning. The title suggests a hands-on, possibly contrarian approach to accessing and leveraging data, which fits the reader's preference for practical experimentation and frameworks. In contrast, Title A, \"The Magnetic Shadow Effect [video],\" is vague, lacks context, and does not clearly connect to any of the core interests (unless the effect is directly related to technology or learning, which is not indicated). Title B is also more likely to offer technical depth, conceptual framing, and actionable takeaways.",

        "reasoning": "Title A, \"Finding and understanding bugs in C compilers,\" suggests a technical deep dive into debugging and compiler reliability, which is interesting for those focused on low-level software engineering. However, it is narrowly focused on C compilers and may be more about technical forensics than frameworks, learning, or meta-level thinking. Title B, \"My 25-year adventure in AI and ML,\" promises a reflective, personal narrative spanning decades of AI and machine learning. This aligns well with the reader's core interests: applied AI, continuous learning, and personal experience. The title hints at lessons learned, possibly frameworks or mental models developed over time, and authentic storytelling—matching the rubric's preference for actionable insights, meta-reflection, and connecting macro trends to personal growth. While Title A is technical, Title B is more likely to offer the kind of reflective, big-picture, and experience-driven content that this reader favors.",

        "title_b": "Darwin Godel Machine: Open-Ended Evolution of Self-Improving Agents",
        "reasoning": "Title A, \"Embabel Agent Framework for the JVM,\" suggests a technical tool or library, likely relevant to Java developers interested in agent-based systems. While this could be interesting from a developer tooling perspective, the title is somewhat generic and doesn't indicate practical takeaways, frameworks, or personal experience. It also lacks a meta, reflective, or contrarian angle.\n\nTitle B, \"Darwin Godel Machine: Open-Ended Evolution of Self-Improving Agents,\" is more conceptually intriguing. It references open-ended evolution and self-improving agents, which ties into core interests around AI, automation, and meta-level thinking about intelligence and learning. The mention of \"Darwin\" and \"Godel\" hints at a deep, possibly contrarian or under-discussed approach to AI, which aligns with the reader's preference for analytical, conceptual, and reflective content. This title promises a big-picture, possibly philosophical exploration of AI systems that can improve themselves—highly relevant to the \"future of programming\" and continuous learning themes.",

        "reasoning": "Title A, \"Pure CSS Moon Phases,\" suggests a technical demonstration or tutorial on creating moon phase visualizations using only CSS. While this is creative and potentially interesting for front-end developers, it is narrowly focused and lacks broader applicability to the reader's core interests, which center on applied AI, developer tooling, frameworks, and big-picture thinking.\n\nTitle B, \"Fei-Fei Li: Spatial intelligence is the next frontier in AI [video],\" directly addresses a major trend in AI, featuring a prominent thought leader. The topic of spatial intelligence in AI is highly relevant to the reader's interest in the future of programming, AI-driven products, and conceptual frameworks. Even though it's a video, the subject matter aligns with the reader's desire to stay ahead of the curve in AI research and to connect macro trends to practical action.",

Return 'A' or 'B' as the preferred title.\n\nUse the following taste rubric as guidance:\nTASTE RUBRIC:\n\n---\n\n### Core Interests \n\nCore interests:\n\nApplied AI and developer tooling – designing and shipping practical AI‑driven products; keen on the “future of programming,” especially ways LLMs can automate or augment software development workflows. You prototype with TypeScript, Next.js, Vitest, Drizzle ORM, and maintain SpecCraft (BDD‑style test logger).\n\nStartup execution and strategy – building companies from zero to one, obsessing over product‑market fit, rapid iteration, and business model design.\n\nTechnical writing and communication – producing crisp, explanatory content about complex systems; using writing as a thinking tool.\n\nScience‑fiction and big‑picture foresight – reading speculative fiction to explore societal and technological trajectories, then mapping those insights back to real‑world product ideas.\n\nDeliberate thinking frameworks – favoring reflective questioning, mental models, and structured reasoning to pressure‑test assumptions and guide decisions.\n\nContinuous learning – voracious reading across AI research, software engineering practices, and adjacent sciences to stay ahead of the curve.\n\n\n### 1.
